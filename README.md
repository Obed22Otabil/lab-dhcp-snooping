DHCP snooping is configured to protect the network from unauthorized DHCP servers. 
It allows the switch to control which ports can send DHCP server messages, ensuring that clients receive IP addresses only from a trusted DHCP server.
By doing this, DHCP snooping:
Prevents fake DHCP servers from assigning wrong IP addresses 
Protects against man-in-the-middle and DHCP spoofing attacks 
Helps maintain correct IP addressing and network stability
